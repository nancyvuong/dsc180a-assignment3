Update (3/25) 10PM to 6AM: I was working on trying to raise my accuracy score (I was able to run it on 423 apps so sample size is not the problem) but now I can longer connect to the dsmlp server so I will take that as my cue to go to sleep.
#
# To Do List (in no particular order):
#
Implement training/testing for AA^T (Done)
# 
Implement training/testing for APA^T  (Done)
#
Make a env file (Done)
#
Run it on malware samples
#
Make the B matrix + everything that needs it (Done + reduced runtime) 
#
Add to the writeup
#
Investigate the problem with constructing the APA^T and ABA^T matrices + the last one
#
Get the training accuracies of the model


# Stretch Goals
Run on a sample size of 400 (Takes very long + I keep disconnecting from DSMLP even with the priority trick on Piazza/I need a school computer for this + my ssh connection gets cut sometimes)
#
Split HW2.py into 2 files
