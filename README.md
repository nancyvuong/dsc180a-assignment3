# dsc180a-assignment3

# To Do List (in no particular order):
#
Implement training/testing for AA^T (Done)
# 
Implement training/testing for APA^T  (Done)
#
Make a env file (Done)
#
Run it on malware samples
#
Make the B matrix + everything that needs it (currently doing but it's taking its sweet time to run on 500K blocks) Update: it finished running on datahub (I'm not ready to experience the absolute feeling of hopelessness when disconnecting from the DSMLP servers) so now I'm letting it run on my laptop while I sleep.
#
Add to the writeup


# Stretch Goals
Run on a sample size of 400 (Takes very long + I keep disconnecting from DSMLP even with the priority trick on Piazza/I need a school computer for this + my ssh connection gets cut sometimes)
#
Split HW2.py into 2 files
